          <li>The Australian Shepherd, or sometimes referred to as the Aussie Shepherd, is a medium-sized breed of dog which was developed in the United States, despite its name.It is very similar in its appearance to the English Shepherd and Border Collie, and indeed, studies have shown they are very similar in relation. Like many herding dogs, they show considerable drive and energy, being best at jobs such as search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, therapy dogs, guide dogs, etc. For these reasons, they have become the 17th most popular dog breed in the United States.</li>

          <li>The dachshund is a breed of dog. It is usually short (small in height), but long from front to back and with short legs. “Dachshund” is a German word that is used in English, and it means “badger dog.” (In German, dachshunds are called Dackel or Teckel.)The breed was developed to use its sense of smell to find, chase, and hunt badgers and other animals that live in holes. A dachshund has a long, narrow body, so it is sometimes called a wiener dog, hot dog, or sausage dog. Some people believe that using those words does not show respect.</li>

          <li>The Yorkshire Terrier or Yorkie is a small breed of terrier dog. It originated in the United Kingdom in the town of Yorkshire, from where it gets its name.They were first bred to catch mice and rats, so they are often fast and energetic. Yorkies usually weigh about 7 pounds (3.18 kg) and have a dark gray or black coat with a brown face. According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), Yorkies are the second most popular dog breed in America, behind only the Labrador Retriever. They are really playful, they will always want to play.</li>
